# FEW-2.4-Native-Apps-with-JavaScript

## Course Description

This class covers how JavaScript can be used to create native desktop and mobile applications.  Using Electron on the desktop and React Native for mobile, applications have the ease of being cross platform and written in JavaScript while still benefiting most of the features of writing in the native language.  Students will deepen their JavaScript knowledge and gain understanding where these JavaScript frameworks can and can not effectively replace native programming.

Tools: JavaScript ES6, React JS, Electron, React Native

### Why you should should take this class?

If your goal is to make the best possible user experiences and products having the ability to make truly native applications is a great tool to have in your arsenal. If you want to broaden your skill set out from the web adding native development is a good direction. If you want get a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language, and if you want to develop your programming knowledge by practicing with Reactive and functional programming concepts.

## Class Assignments



### Tutorials

- React Redux Review Tutorial Choose one
	- [Timers - React + Redux](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/react-redux-passwords-app-tutorial-oh4) 
	- [Tetris - React + Redux](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/react-redux-tetris-app-tutorial-o4s)
- [React Native Tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/wthr-native-tutorial-mvs)

### Projects

- Electron Project
- React Native Project
- Custom Project 

**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class. 

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

### Final Exam

-  **Passing the exam is a requirement for passing the class.**
- You will have 2 hours to complete this exam - it will be in class using paper and pencil, or a format of the instructor's choosing
- There are no retakes of the exam.
- If you have a disability that needs an accommodation such as extended time or a different format, please take advantage of our [accommodations program](make.sc/disability-policy).

### Other Class assignments

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials 
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
