This week you'll use your application, take notes, and implement changes that will improve it. Changes can be anything that you think of. The goal is to think of improvement from a users perspective by being that user! 

- Changes to color and design
- Changes to user interface and interaction
- Software changes that improve the operation

### Why this assignment?

Dog Fooding is a practice used at lots of companies. Think about FaceBook and Twitter. Apple and Micrsoft use this internally also. 

## Project requirements

Use your application this week as it was intended to be used. 

Take notes while you use the app and make the changes you think would improve the product.
