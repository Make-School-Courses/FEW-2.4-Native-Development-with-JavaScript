1. Customize the `Item` component to display other info related to the breed. 

2. Use Styles to customize the appearance of cells. 

3. Display the other data. Note that each breed doesn't always have the same data/keys as other breeds. You'll need to get the keys and display the data for the available keys. You can use `Object.keys(data)` to get an array of keys on `data`. 

4. Display dogs, if you haven't, cats if you have.
