## Basic Components 

Look at the [example project](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/react-native-components)

The components I've chosen for this demo are not specific to iOS or Android  and are common to both. They will be rendered in the style that matches the platform but ottherwise are configured and function the same on both platforms. 

Apply some of the ideas from this example project to the Wthr tutorial.
