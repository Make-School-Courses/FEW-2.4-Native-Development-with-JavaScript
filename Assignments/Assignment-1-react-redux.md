# Class - Assignment Title 

## React/Redux review and practice

Review practice and brush up your React and Redux skills by completing one of the tutorials below. Choose one of the tutorials below to work on. 

There are three tutorials listed by level of difficulty. 

1. [Password App](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/web-7-react-redux-passwords-app)
2. [Timers App](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/web-7-react-redux-timers-app)
3. [Tetris App](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/web-7-react-redux-tetris-app)

All of tutorials use React and Redux and range from medium to medium difficult complexity. 

Each of these tutorials creates a complete self contained app. There is not network or server required. You'll be using your completed tutorial to create a desktop application. 

### Why this assignment?

React is one of the most popular libraries around today. Seriously, you should know it! React is good to learn now since it has huge and well-deserved popularity.

Looks to me like it's a good time to learn React. That said, it won't be here forever and you are capable of learning any framework. React is a good place to invest your time right now.
