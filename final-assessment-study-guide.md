To pass this class you have to master the learning objectives. We can distill these into the skills listed below: 

- [Create a new React native project with Expo](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/FEW-2.4-Native-Development-with-JavaScript/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson-04.md#getting-started)
- Use the following native components
	- [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
	- [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) 
	- [Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button) 
	- [FlatList](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/FEW-2.4-Native-Development-with-JavaScript/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson-04.md#implement-flatlist)
	- [ScrollView](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/FEW-2.4-Native-Development-with-JavaScript/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson-04.md#implement-scrollview) 
	- [SafeAreaView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/safeareaview)

	- Stack navigator 
	- [Tab Navigator](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/FEW-2.4-Native-Development-with-JavaScript/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson-08.md#tab-navigator)

You should be able to create an app that runs in Expo.
