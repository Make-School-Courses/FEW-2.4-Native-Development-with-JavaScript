# FEW 2.4 Class 2 - Redux Review 

## Review and Dig into Redux

## Learning Objectives 

1. Define Actions, Reducers, and Store
1. Use Redux to manage application state 
1. Create container components implement React Redux
1. Use the react controlled component pattern

## Why learn this?

The controlled component pattern is a common pattern to know with Redux. 

Redux is a great system from managing state. If you've ever struggled with complex application state in the past you know how much trouble you can have, amnd how much work it can be to reinvent the wheel for each new project. 

Using Redux will solve many common problems and give you a system that you apply to almost any project. 

## Build a todolist

Build a Todo list. Look at the [sample code](https://github.com/soggybag/redux-todo). 

Currently the application allows you to add items to the list. Each item shows a name and a "completed" state as an X on the right. 

Items are stored in Redux. `TodoList` displays a list of `Todo`. 

New Todo uses the [controlled pattern](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html). Use this with all form elements. 

### Organizing code

The project contains several components organized in folders. 

- `App` : The main view of the project. You can think of this as the entry point for you code. 
- `todo-new` : An input field and button that creates a new todo with a name
- `todo-list` : Displays a list of `todo` items
- `todo` : Displays a single todo item with a name and completed status

Components that use more than one file are organized in folders. 

### Using Stylesheets

Components have been styled using stylesheets. By convention  by making a name of the stylesheet match the component. 

Use class names within the stylesheet to assign styles to elements. 

Import the stylesheet into a component using: 

`import './component-name.css`

### Connecting Components 

Components can connect themselves to the store using 'react-redux'. This library provides the connect method for this purpose. 

`connect` takes two parameters. 

- `mapStateToProps(state)` takes state as a parameter and maps values to props on a components. This means you get valeus from state from props! The return value should be an object with the properties that you want to map to props. 
- `mapDispatchToProps()` this function returns an object with properties whose values are 

## Local Storage 

Local storage allows your apps to save data in the browser. This gives your apps the abilioty to save information without and internet connection, a login, database, or other tooling. 

Local storage saves data in key value pairs. Values must be simple either strings or numbers. 

This sounds pretty limited. Using JSON allows you to convert collections, like objects and arrays, to a string which can be saved. 

Save data with: 

`localStorage.setItem(key, data)`

Fetch data with: 

`localStorage.getItem(key)`

Convert complex values with `JSON.stringify()`

NOTE! Objects and Arrays can contain functions which can not be converted to JSON!

Use this with 

## Adding features 

You need to implement some features. How would you implement the following features? 

- Mark todos when completed
- Sort the todo list by completed
- Filter for completed or not completed
- Delete a todo from the list
- Edit the name of a todo in the list
