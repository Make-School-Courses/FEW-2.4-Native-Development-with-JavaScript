# FEW 2.4 Class 1 - Native Applications with JavaScript

## Introduction

The purpose of this class is to expand your JavaScript skills by exploring native applications built with JS. 

## Your Goals

Goals - 

Two goals will bring you success: building portfolio projects and mastering learning objectives. 

During this class, you will build two portfolio projects that show off your front end skills. I will present ideas and projects, you need to take them to completion.

If you have ideas that are outside the description of the project talk to the instructor. We will always be willing to work with you. My only request will be the projects include the learning objectives and the scope of the project to be reasonable.

What are the learning objectives? 

Iâ€™ll present ideas in class and give them a descriptor. These are learning objectives, concepts, and ideas that you need to know to claim mastery of the subject. Learning Objectives are often skills that are related to success at job interviews and on the job. 

When you understand a learning objective you will be able to explain it and put it into practice. There will be learning objectives for each class. You should test your knowledge by explaining the concepts to someone else. Implement the learning objectives in code when the learning objectives are code. Some objectives are larger overarching concepts, in these cases, you should identify the learning objective in your code, your project as a whole, or in the larger software ecosystem or the world at large. 

If you are having trouble understanding a learning objective you need to take action. Discuss the topic with another student, talk with a TA, bring questions to the class, talk to an instructor during lab or office hours. 

## Learning Objectives

1. Define Components with Class and function syntax
    - Component Architecture
    - Props and State
    - JSX
1. Compare and contrast Web and Native Applications 
1. Compare and contrast Mobile vs Desktop experiences

## Why Learn React? 

React is one of the most popular libraries around today. Seriously, you should know it! React is good to learn now since it has huge and well-deserved popularity.

Here is a good look at the reasons to learn React, Vue, or Angular.

Check out the state of JavaScript 2019:

Looks to me like it's a good time to learn React. That said, it won't be here forever and you are capable of learning any framework. React is a good place to invest your time right now. 

## React Review

Build a Cookie Clicker in class?

- What is a [clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker)? 
- [Universal Paper Clips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)
- [Incremental Game Math](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/numbers-getting-bigger-the-design-and-math-of-incremental-games--cms-24023)

Redux would be a great way to create a complex cookie clicker game. 

Build the following components

- Couter Display
- Counter 
    - Button add to count
    - Upgrade button
- Auto Counter
    - Upgrade button

Review practice and brush up your React and Redux skills by completing one of the tutorials below.

Choose a tutorial to work on. Your goal is to complete your chosen tutorial before class next week.

There are three tutorials listed by level of difficulty.
